Find the Smallest Missing Positive Integer
https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/software-engineer-prep-kit/challenges/find-smallest-missing-positive-integer/problem?isFullScreen=true

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the smallest positive integer not present in the array in O(n) time and O(1) extra space.

Example

Input

orderNumbers = [3, 4, -1, 1]

Output

2

Explanation

We want the smallest positive missing integer.

Start with [3, 4, -1, 1]
- i=0: value 3 ⇒ swap with index 2 ⇒ [-1, 4, 3, 1]
- i=0: value -1 is out of range ⇒ move on
- i=1: value 4 ⇒ swap with index 3 ⇒ [-1, 1, 3, 4]
- i=1: value 1 ⇒ swap with index 0 ⇒ [1, -1, 3, 4]
- now 1 at index 0, 3 at 2, 4 at 3; -1 remains at index 1

Scan from index 0:
index 0 has 1 (correct), index 1 has -1 (not 2) ⇒ missing positive is 2

Input Format

An integer n on the first line, where 0 ≤ n ≤ 1000.  
The next n lines contains an integer representing orderNumbers[i].

Example

4  
3  
4  
-1  
1  

Here 4 is the length of array, followed by the elements of array on each line.

Constraints

0 <= orderNumbers.length <= 1000  
-10^9 <= orderNumbers[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < orderNumbers.length  
Duplicates are allowed in orderNumbers  
Negative numbers and zero are allowed in orderNumbers

Output Format

A single integer denoting the smallest positive order number (≥1) that does not appear in the input array.

Sample Input 0  
0

Sample Output 0  
1

Sample Input 1  
1  
1

Sample Output 1  
2

# Notes
The solution space is much smaller than the range of numbers in the list.  
In the worst computational case, you get an list from 1..n and the result is n+1.  
Otherwise, you may get a noisy list with negatives, duplicates and numbers larger than the length of the list, getting rid of the noise is key.
